    A studio for experiments, <i>microproducts</i>, and creative tech that

  manifesto: `
    We system-pair creatives and technologists to build together. Not forever,
    just for a while. We don't scale, we don't optimise, we don't repeat. Each
    project is an excuse to learn, an experiment, a <i>microproduct</i> (sometimes
    useful, sometimes funny, sometimes both). Curatorship is the method, collaboration
    is the form, publication is the output. We work locally, specifically, briefly,
    leaving traces but no traffic. No roadmap, no KPIs, no funnels, just curiosity
    and a deadline. 3 months max. Open source only.
